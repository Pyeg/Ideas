Ideas for projects and stuff to build or work on in Python Egypt.

Contribution and discussion takes place in the [issues](https://github.com/Pyeg/Ideas/issues).

What is PyEG?
--------------

Pyeg is meant to be an online place where we - as python developers - can gather, share ideas and collaborate on projects. We started using the Ideas repo to list ideas for projects the members think they may like to collaborate on and there is a need for them. However, we now decided to make it more flexible to discuss any ideas about the python development community we wish to build.

In brief, we believe the best way for us to create a community for python developers, is to build such community around code, we better collaborate on coding rather than anything else. Hence, we use github and encourage members to collaborate on pythonic projects here.
